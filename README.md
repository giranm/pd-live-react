## Development

#### Register PagerDuty App

If you wish to maintain + deploy your own version of PagerDuty Live, we recommend registering a new OAuth app as follows:

- Within PagerDuty developer mode, [register a new app](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTY5-register-an-app)
- [Add OAuth 2.0 workflow](<(https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTcz-o-auth-2-0-functionality#add-oauth-20-functionality-to-your-app)>) to the app and update the URL to the app host URL

#### Local Development

1. Install [NodeJS v16.13](https://nodejs.org/tr/blog/release/v16.13.0/) via [`asdf install`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) / [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

2. Install `craco` via `$ yarn install @craco/craco --save --global`  
   (NB - you may need to reload terminal session to use the alias)

3. `$ git clone` repo to desired destination and `$ cd pd-live-react` into directory

4. Create `.env` file in project root with overriding configuration (see section below for details)

5. Install dependencies with `$ yarn install` and run application locally using `$ yarn start`  
   The app will be available under http://localhost:3000/pd-live-react

## Environment Overrides

The following _optional_ parameters can be used in a `.env` file to override PagerDuty Live during `$ yarn start`:

| `REACT_APP_PD_USER_TOKEN` | PagerDuty [Personal API Token](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#generating-a-personal-rest-api-key); this will override OAuth login workflow if set and should be used for integration tests|

## Testing

The following scripts have been created to run unit, component, and integration tests:

- `$ yarn jest` (Jest Unit/Component)
- `$ yarn cypress:ci:chrome` (Cypress Integration with headless Chromedriver)

Please note that running integration tests will require environment variable `REACT_APP_PD_USER_TOKEN` set.  

The integration tests also assume the PagerDuty account associated with the above user token has been setup with the following [Terraform environment](https://github.com/giranm/pd-live-integration-test-environment).
